KW GeeseCam Website

This is the web portion of the TrailCam project. The website is a template that connects to a REST call that in turn connects to a mysql database running on the webhost. The TrailCam software uploads the details on the photos to the same REST service. This allows the photos to be displayed from the website by generating portions of the page in Javascript code.
