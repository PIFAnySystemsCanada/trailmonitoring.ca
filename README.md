# Trail Monitoring System Website

This repo holds the TMS website. The trail monitoring system is a system for monitoring mountain bike trails and sending information to users.

Currently, this is a completely static website using HTML and some embedded Javascript. At some point, it will be converted to a Hugo template to prevent the need for all the copy and paste between pages.

There is a REST API in the api directory, but it is not being used. The embedded Javascript code assumes there are three thingspeak channels in use and they are specific to this project. Because it is hosted on Github, none of the php backend code is available to be used nor is it used.
